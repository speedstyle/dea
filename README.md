## Not DEA
DEA was great, and then it was gone. I am working to port DEA to `discord.py` rewrite, so that it is readable, documented and expandable, and people don't criticize me for just copying over someone else's code (which, to be clear, is exactly what I have done).

## What's in a name?
I am going to name it something like **ATF** in order to keep with the naming scheme without pretending to be the original. References to *Narcos* will go straight over my head so many of them may be removed unintentionally - partially justifying the fact that the name will no longer be drug-related.
